Some of the stuff I've worked on for fun:

[Conway's Game of Life]({{ 'game-of-life.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

This is a react.js implementation of the classic game/simulator. I, quite unnecessarily, used redux and immutable.js for the data store. If you like to read codes:
{% include icon-github-project.html username=site.github_username repo_name='game-of-life.react' project_name='game-of-life' %}
