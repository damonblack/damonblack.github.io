"... in the middle of a stream..."

I think it's about time for me to shake things up. Ten years ago, I started a new career doing something I'd learned as a hobby. It was great.

It still is. But something is missing. The ever-present pressure to be a "productive member of society" has sucked me into a bit of a rut. In my heart of hearts, I don't give one rat's ass about clickthrough or conversion rates, and the last thing I want to do is maximize ad "impressions"
