Most web developers are familiar with the concept of 'opinionated software'. 
The idea is that development software (frameworks, libraries, languages, 
etc... ) can be designed in a way that guides developers toward best (or at 
least consistent) practices. For the most, I agree with the consensus that 
it's a good thing.

But I think some developers have taken this mantra to heart, and see it as 
an excuse to be 'opinionated' in their own work. This works ok as long as everyone 
on a given project is of a simliar opinion. But it breaks down when they're not. 
And they hardly ever are.
